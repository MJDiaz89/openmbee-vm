    Login to View Editor:
    ---------------------
    You can login to the View Editor by going to:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/alfresco/mmsapp/mms.html#/login

    and the values of MMS_USERNAME and MMS_PASSWORD in the .env file to log in. The default is `admin` for both.

    Troubleshoot:
    -------------
    If that URL is missing, make sure Alfresco is running, by going to:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/alfresco

    If that is not working, checkout the container logs by:

    1. SSH'ing into the VM: `vagrant ssh`
    2. Make sure the services are running: `dc ps`
    3. And inspecting the logs: `dc logs`

    Note:
    -----
    This VM contains some custom commands and aliases to help experienced users.  To see these commands
    ssh into the VM, and type `commands`.

    Important Notice:
    -----------------
